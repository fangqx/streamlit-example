# Welcome to Streamlit!

Edit `/streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire :heart:

If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""

# Everything is accessible via the st.secrets dict:
headers={"authorization":st.secrets["db_usename"],"content-type":"application/json"}
#st.write("DB username:", st.secrets["db_username"])
#st.write("DB password:", st.secrets["db_password"])
#st.write("My cool secrets:", st.secrets["my_cool_secrets"]["things_i_like"])

# And the root-level secrets are also accessible as environment variables:


st.write('hello world')
st.write('good morning')
